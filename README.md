Sample-Browser
==============

A little experiment to see how much of a web browser I could make in 30 minutes. This is licensed under the BSD license.

I'll add that, while it compiles, it doesn't necessarily do downloads, even though there's code in there. I was working on that when the 30 minute mark hit... If anyone wants to add this in, be my guest. I'll always take pull requests. :)
